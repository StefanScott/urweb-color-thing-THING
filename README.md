# urweb-color-thing-THING

This code is identical to the code for the other repository urweb-color-thing-T except:

- Here the table is named thing - and in the other repository it is named t

This code doesn't compile.

The code in the other repository compiles and runs.

Compile error message is shown in Issue 1.

Thanks for any help!
