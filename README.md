# urweb-color-thing-THING

The code in this repo is identical to the code in the other repo `urweb-color-thing-T` except:

- Here the "child" table is named `thing` - and in the other repository it is named `t`

The code in *this* repo doesn't compile.

The code in the *other* repo compiles and runs fine!

The compile errors for this repo are shown in in Issue 1.

Thanks for any help!
